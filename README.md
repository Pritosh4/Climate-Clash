## Inspiration
After I started coming to college, I noticed a pattern wherein I would quickly fall sick and it would take me around three days to recover each time I came back to campus from home. This observation sparked my curiosity, and I decided to investigate the possible reasons behind my frequent illnesses. I decided to analyse the climatic data of my college and compare it to the weather conditions back home.

## Process
To begin my analysis, I collected data on various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed for both my college location and my hometown. I obtained historical weather data for the corresponding periods of time when I experienced sickness episodes.
Using Tableau, I visualized this data in multiple ways to gain the necessary insights required to reach a detailed answer.

## Reflection
After looking at all the parameters I was able to understand that though the varying temperature did play a role but the main reason behind my sickness was actually the humidity and the wind speed. The difference in the wind speed and humidity between the 2 places was much greater and more effective on my health as compared to the temperature.
